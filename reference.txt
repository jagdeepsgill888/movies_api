login 3 tries lock
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30770438/blocked-the-user-after-3-attempts-in-php

I used bits of the way discussed here to create a way to stop user from logining in.
If the  failed login attempts exceeds remain logins available, it will stop the user.
by ending the proccess.

I added a simple subtraction for counting the reamining logins available and displayed it for users to see only many
tries they have left.

I used a similar way for finding , storing and updating ($update_user_query) our ip, date, last login date etc and for counting the user's Succesful login.

Wrote each of them into the session eg $_SESSION['user_lastdate'] for getting the past date.

It (the login count) is then stored in the column "user_login_succ". When a user logins in and it will update the number.
I added a simple addition to help me count 1 succesful with current number stored in the db. 
It added 1 each time a user logs in.

$loginsucc for Succesful login count,  $date for dates ,  $messagelogin for remaiming logins etc
