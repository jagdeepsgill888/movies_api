I used the php mail() function to send mail to users after signing up
Docker mailhog was not sending mail in the class build so i switched to use wamp smtp with my gmail account to see and send emails.
The mail function is used in the user.php. It sends  subject, header username, password and a url etc.

**only use only email real domains like xxxXXX@gmail.com / xxxXXX@yahool.com for when signing up a user


2. Generate password

Created a function for generating a random password from all the characters ,numbers and signs.
(Used str_shuffle, substr)

Then i called out the function in admin_createuser.php's forms password field (the value). This way the the password is auto filled and changes whenver the page is refreshed.

i have yet to figure out how to decrypt the password.

if (password_verify($password, $hash)) for login
is my next step but im not sure im if doing it right because it doesnt seems to work no matter what i try.
